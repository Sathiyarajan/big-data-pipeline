1. What is Apache Flume
Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available service for
efficiently collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of event
data. It has a simple and flexible architecture based on streaming
data flows. It is robust and fault tolerant with tunable reliability
mechanisms and many failover and recovery mechanisms. Flume uses a
simple, extensible data model that allows for online analytic
application.

2. Status of this release
Apache Flume 1.9.0 is the 12th release of Flume as an Apache top-level
project (TLP). Apache Flume 1.9.0 is production-ready software.

3. Major changes in this Release
For a detailed list of changes, please see the CHANGELOG file included
in this distribution.

Apache Flume versions 1.0.0 and greater represent a major refactoring of the
Flume codebase and are not backwards compatible with the 0.9.x series of Flume
releases. However, the developers of Flume strive to maintain backwards
compatibility within the 1.x codeline.

4. How to Get Involved

5. How to Report Issues
The Apache Flume project uses JIRA for issue tracking. Please report any issues
you find at http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLUME

6. Important notice about configuration change in the next Release
Flume 1.x has been distributed with Log4j 1.x until version 1.9.0.
From the next minor release Flume is going to be distributed with Log4j 2.x.
This is going to require logger configuration changes in existing installations during upgrade.
