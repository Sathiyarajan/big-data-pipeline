        // correct location based upon their input.
        // The player should be able to type commands such as "Go West", "run South", or just "East"
        // and the program will move to the appropriate location if there is one.  As at present, an
        // attempt to move in an invalid direction should print a message and remain in the same place.

        // Single letter commands (N, W, S, E, Q) should still be available.
