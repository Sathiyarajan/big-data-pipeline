        // The purpose of the application is to help a ficticious company called Bills Burgers to manage
        // their process of selling hamburgers.
        // Our application will help Bill to select types of burgers, some of the additional items (additions) to
        // be added to the burgers and pricing.
        // We want to create a base hamburger, but also two other types of hamburgers that are popular ones in
        // Bills store.
        // The basic hamburger should have the following items.
        // bread roll type, meat and up to 4 additional additions (things like lettuce, tomato, carrot, etc) that
        // the customer can select to be added to the burger. Each one of these items gets charged an additional
        // price so you need some way to track how many items got added and to calculate the price (for the base
        // burger and all the additions).
        // This burger has a base price and the additions are all seperately priced.
        // Create a Hamburger class to deal with all the above.
        // The constructor should only include the roll type, meat and price.
        // Also create two extra varieties of Hamburgers (classes) to cater for
        // a) Healthy burger (on a brown rye bread roll), plus two addition items can be added.
        // The healthy burger can have a total of 6 items (Additions) in total.
        // hint:  you probably want to process the 2 additional items in this new class, not the base class,
        // since the 2 additions are only appropriate for this new class.
        // b) Deluxe hamburger - comes with chips and drinks as additions, but no extra additions are allowed.
        // hint:  You have to find a way to automatically add these new additions at the time the deluxe burger
        // object is created, and then prevent other additions being made.
        //  All 3 classes should have a method that can be called anytime to show the base price of the hamburger
        // plus all additionals, each showing the addition name, and addition price, and a grand total for the
        // burger
        // For the two additional classes this may require you to be looking at the base class for pricing and then
        // adding totals onto that.
