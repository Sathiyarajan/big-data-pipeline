Developers have always loved Apache Spark for providing APIs that are simple yet powerful, a combination of traits that makes complex analysis possible with minimal programmer effort.  At Databricks, we have continued to push Spark’s usability and performance envelope through the introduction of DataFrames and Spark SQL. These are high-level APIs for working with structured data (e.g. database tables, JSON files), which let Spark automatically optimize both storage and computation. Behind these APIs, the Catalyst optimizer and Tungsten execution engine optimize applications in ways that were not possible with Spark’s object-oriented (RDD) API, such as operating on data in a raw binary form.
